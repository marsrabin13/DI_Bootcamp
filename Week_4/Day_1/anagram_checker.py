# What you will create


# 🌟 Anagram checker
# We will create a program that will ask the user for a word.
# It will check if the word is a valid English word, and then find all possible anagrams for that word.


# Instructions
# First Download this text file

# Create a new file called anagram_checker.py which contains a class called AnagramChecker.
# The class should have the following methods:
# __init__ - should load the word list file (text file) into a variable, so that it can be searched later on in the code.
# is_valid_word(word) – should check if the given word (ie. the word of the user) is a valid word.

# get_anagrams(word) – should find all anagrams for the given word. (eg. if word of the user is ‘meat’, the function should return a list containing [“mate”, “tame”, “team”].)

class AnagramChecker:
    def __init__(self, file_path="DI_Bootcamp\\Week_4\\Day_1\\sowpods.txt"):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            self.word_list = [line.strip().lower() for line in file]

    def is_valid_word(self, word):
        return word.lower() in self.word_list

    def is_anagram(self, word1, word2):
        return sorted(word1.lower()) == sorted(word2.lower())

    def get_anagrams(self, word):
        anagrams = [w for w in self.word_list if self.is_anagram(word, w) and w != word.lower()]
        return anagrams

# Hint: you might want to create a separate method called is_anagram(word1, word2), that will compare 2 words and return True if they contain the same letters (but not in the same order), and False if not.

# Note: None of the methods in the class should print anything.
